# Heading

1 page for the visualization itself: This should be a live, interactive version of the visualization you created. It is important that the visualization works in the Chrome web browser - this is the platform that we will be using for evaluating your work.
1 documentation page that describes your work and documents the following:
Your design process: How did you go about designing the visualization? What are some of the initial designs / ideas you attempted in the beginning? A good way to document your design process is to scan your sketches and include them in the documentation page.
Rationale of your design choices: This should be a rigorous explanation of the design choices you made. For example, why did you use color to encode a particular variable? Why did you arrange your charts in a particular way?
Describe how you used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions you had. Include evidence to support your findings as screenshots from the visualization. In this case, we have a clear hypothesis to start with, but are there other nuggets of insights one can uncover?
