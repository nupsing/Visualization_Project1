# Description of Design Process
I read the input files to understand how to connect the dataset with each other. Read the supporting pages to understand the cholera outbreak in London.

# Justification of Design Decisions
1. I created the streets chart first and included the location of pumps using the given data for pumps location.
2. Tried to plot a seperate chart for gender and number of deaths per gender.
3. Selected the colors for workhouse and brewery based on color coding palette.
4. Plotted the count of deaths per day line chart with x-axis representing the dates and y-axis representing the total deaths.
5. The labels shows variables and colors used to represent the data. For example, for representing gender used blue and for female used orange.
6. Included the given data of gender and age deaths in streets chart.
7. Tried to establish linking on hover of line chart, the streets chart will show the points where the deaths took place.
